      I am a third year student at Fordham University studying journalism and history. I am interested in mapping changes in news media, personal technology, and political engagement, as well as understanding how those trends shape our communities over time. I am an assistant Arts and Culture editor at <i>The Observer</i> and a current intern at New Village Press in New York City.
